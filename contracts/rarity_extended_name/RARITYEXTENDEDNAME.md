## RarityExtended Name

Rarity Extended Name is a smartContract that will be used with RarityExtended to provide some personalization on the aventurers, allowing the players to set names for their characters, including :
- **The Firstname** aka `John` for example
- **The Lastname** aka `Doe` for example
- **The Surname** aka `The mighty Unknow Warrior` for example

There is no specific restrictions, names can be anything you want, but it's better to keep it short, may or may not be unique. You can use the same name for multiple characters, and UIs can choose to use your full name or some parts.
This is supposed to be an alternative to [Rarity Name](https://ftmscan.com/address/0xc73e1237a5a9ba5b0f790b6580f32d04a727dc19) (which work more like an ENS) to get a bit more "RP feel".
